4970116 - Report Etude 5

We have a set of points and the variable of a radius of the circle.

The program creates initially tries to iterate through all the possible combinations of circles created from all the points.
We first check if the first two points are further away than the size of the minimum circle. If so then we skip the current
set of points and go to the next set of points. Otherwise we check to see if the number of points lying within this circle less than 11
and the number lying on the edges and inside is more than 11. If it is then we set the minimum size as the new circle radius.

We do this for each set of 2 and 3 points, with the 3 point circle checks being nested inside the 2 point checks. So that if the distance
between the 2 points is larger than the minimum circle than we know the 3 point circle is larger than the minimum and we do not need to check it.
We also have a few checks to make sure that if we have 3 points they do not sit on a single line and that the points we have are not the same
as each other.
